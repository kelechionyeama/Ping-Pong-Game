# Ping-Pong-Game
This is a super simple ping-pong game using python. 2 players use the same keyboard to control their pads and hit the ball back to one another. Also the speed of the game increases as players keep going!

Here are the controls and rules to the game
- Left pad is controlled using the "w" key to go up and the "s" key to go down
- Right pad is controlled using the keyboard-up key to go up and the keyboard-down key to go down
- If your opponent manages to get the ball past you, they gain a point.
- As players play without losing the ball, the speed of the ball increases until one person loses!
